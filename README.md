# mycompat: auto-generated job quantization
がんばったけど......

- Do something like [kasako's PR](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529002857), with auto-generation feature and simpler mechanics
- Crime, housing, amenity, happiness, empire sprawl, diplomatic value calculations are not implemented yet
- Planet query dialog and pop excess migration are implemented (plz copy localisation directory for your language)
- Temporary job / minimum unemployment are not implemented yet
